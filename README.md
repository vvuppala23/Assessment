**Speer QA Testing Engineer Assessment**

**Part 2 - Please provide a link to a public Github/GitLab repository.**

Feel free to use any language/framework you feel comfortable with.

Write a simple script which:
1) Accepts a Wikipedia link - return/throw an error if the link is not a valid wiki link
2) Accepts a valid integer between 1 to 20 - call it n
3) Scrape the link provided in Step 1, for all wiki links embedded in the page and store them in a data structure of your choice.
4) Repeat Step 3 for all newly found links and store them in the same data structure.
5) This process should terminate after n cycles.

Optional:
1) Optimize your code not to visit any links you've already visited.
2) Write the results ( all found links, total count, unique count ) to a CSV/JSON file.
